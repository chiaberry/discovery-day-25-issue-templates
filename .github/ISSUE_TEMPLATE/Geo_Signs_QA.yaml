        Regular QA/QC of SMD Sign Assets. New work orders for sign asset installs and removals are loaded into the dataset on a weekly occurrence. As the quantity of incoming sign asset data varies, the level of work and amount of time spent also varies. Generally, I tend to spend anywhere from 8 to 30 hours performing QA/QC on this dataset.
        Additionally, there is the clean-up project, prioritizing clean-up of certain MUTCD codes throughout older data where QA was never completed. I am approximately 2/3 through this clean-up project for zones Alpha and Bravo which encompass most of downtown and central Austin.
